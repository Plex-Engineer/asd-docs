title: Slippage
description: Math Behind calculating slippage
---

When initially depositing a stablecoin (ex. USDC) into the asD contract, it is swapped for \$NOTE on the Canto Network DEX.
This swap is subject to slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed.
The price of a trade is determined by the ratio of reserves in the pool and may not always be a 1:1 ratio of the two assets (stablecoin & \$NOTE).

### Calculating Expected asD

The expected asD is calculated by estimating the amount of \$NOTE that will be received from the swap. CantoDex pairs have a function that returns the amount of \$NOTE that will be received from a swap of a given amount of stablecoin.
This function is used to calculate the expected asD.

```solidity
function getAmountOut(uint amountIn, address tokenIn) external view returns (uint);
```

### SDK Usage

The SDK has a function that can be used to calculate the expected asD given a stablecoin amount. This can be used to estimate the slippage value when depositing stablecoins into the asD contract.

```typescript
import { getExpectedAsD } from "sdk-example";

const expectedAsD = await getExpectedAsD({
  coin: { address: "0x...", amount: "" },
  originChain: "ethereum",
});
```
